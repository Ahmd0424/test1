      Leopards (Panthera pardus kotiya) are elusive and majestic creatures that
      can be found in various national parks and wildlife reserves across Sri
      Lanka. Here are three notable venues where leopards are often spotted:

    <h3>1. Yala National Park</h3>
    <p>
      Yala National Park, located in the southeastern part of Sri Lanka, is
      renowned for its high leopard population. The park's diverse landscapes,
      including scrub jungles, coastal lagoons, and open plains, provide an
      ideal habitat for leopards. Visitors to Yala have a significant chance of
      encountering these elusive cats, especially in Block I, where leopard
      sightings are frequent.

    <h3>2. Wilpattu National Park</h3>
    <p>
      As the largest national park in Sri Lanka, Wilpattu, situated in the
      northwest, boasts a thriving leopard population. The park's unique
      combination of natural lakes, or "villus," and dense jungles offers an
      excellent environment for leopard sightings. The vast and pristine
      wilderness of Wilpattu provides a tranquil setting for observing these
      magnificent big cats.

    <h3>3. Horton Plains National Park</h3>
    <p>
      Located in the central highlands, Horton Plains National Park is home to a
      population of leopards adapted to high-altitude environments. The park's
      grasslands and cloud forests create a distinctive backdrop for leopard
      encounters. While less frequented by tourists, Horton Plains provides a
      unique opportunity to observe leopards in a unique ecological setting.

    <h3>Threat : Human - WildLife Conflict</h3>
    <br />
    <img src="Conf.jpg" />

    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>
      Human-wildlife conflict poses a significant threat to leopard populations
      globally, including in Sri Lanka. As human settlements expand into natural
      habitats, conflicts arise due to competition for space and resources.
      Leopards may enter villages or agricultural areas in search of prey,
      leading to confrontations with local communities.
    </p>

    <h4>Consequences:</h4>
    <p>
      The consequences of human-leopard conflict are detrimental for both humans
      and leopards. Retaliatory killings, often driven by fear and perceived
      threats to livestock or human safety, contribute to a decline in leopard
      populations. Additionally, injured or displaced leopards may struggle to
      survive in altered environments, disrupting the delicate balance of
      ecosystems.
    </p>

    <h4>Mechanisms to Reduce the Threat:</h4>

    <h5>1. Community Education</h5>
    <p>
      Raising awareness among local communities about leopard behavior,
      ecological importance, and proper livestock management helps foster
      understanding and tolerance. Educational programs aim to reduce fear and
      promote coexistence.
    </p>

    <h5>2. Implementation of Non-lethal Deterrents:</h5>
    <p>
      Deploying non-lethal methods to deter leopards from entering human
      settlements, such as secure livestock pens, motion-activated lights, and
      alarm systems, helps minimize interactions and potential conflicts.
    </p>

    <h5>3. Habitat Management:</h5>
    <p>
      Preserving and restoring natural habitats for leopards reduces the
      likelihood of them venturing into human-dominated areas. Conservation
      initiatives focus on maintaining ecological corridors and protected spaces
      for wildlife.
    </p>

    <h5>4. Community-based Conservation Programs:</h5>
    <p>
      Involving local communities in conservation efforts empowers them to
      actively participate in leopard protection. Establishing community-based
      conservation programs encourages responsible tourism, generates income,
      and instills a sense of pride in preserving wildlife.
    </p>

    <h5>5. Conflict Resolution Protocols:</h5>
    <p>
      Developing protocols for managing conflicts, including trained response
      teams and protocols for safely relocating leopards, helps address specific
      incidents in a manner that ensures the safety of both humans and wildlife.
